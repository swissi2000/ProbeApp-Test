# Touch Probe Calibration

## Description
Most mechanical Touch Probes used in the DIY space are based on a design like this:

Touch Probes based on this design usually have no pre-travel when triggered along the stylus axis for Z-axis measurements. The same is not true when the touch probe stylus is triggered in the X-Y-Plane. 
There is a pre-travel of the stylus before a trigger signal occurs and because of the 3 leg design, that pre-travel is not uniform over a 360 degree trigger range.

There's not just a geometrically based pre-travel variation, there's also a significant variation in stylus deflection caused by the change in trip-force based on the trip angle. The trip-force variation can easily exceed 50g based on the trip angle.

If you wonder how much deflection a trip force of 50g can cause to your stylus. enter the parameters of your probes stylus into this [Deflection Calculator](https://cmms.com/pages/deflection-calculator-tm) and be surprised.
